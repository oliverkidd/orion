# Configuration

<sub>[← README](../README.md) · [Keys](keys.md) · [Commands](commands.md) · [Sessions](sessions.md) · [Configuration](configuration.md) · [How it works](how-it-works.md)</sub>

CONFIG.JSON is the settings file, in the DATA DIR beside the SQLITE STORE — hand-editable, and
what the `s` SETTINGS OVERLAY writes:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.orion.orion/config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/orion/config.json`
- `ORION_CONFIG_FILE` moves that one file — into a dotfiles checkout, say — and leaves everything
  else where it is. A save writes through a symlink instead of replacing it, so linking `config.json`
  into a repo works as well.
- `ORION_DATA_DIR` moves the whole directory, config included (tests, parallel instances).
- `orion config path` prints where each settings file is.

CONFIG.LOCAL.JSON, beside it in the DATA DIR, has the same keys and wins over `config.json` one key at
a time. It is for what only makes sense on this machine — an editor a remote box lacks,
`prewarm_agents: false` on a small one — and it is never exported, never sent over `orion ssh`, and
never written by an import. Create it by hand with just the keys to pin; after that the overlay
writes a key it holds back into it, so changing that setting here keeps it local, and every other key
into `config.json`:

```json
{ "editor": "nano", "prewarm_agents": false }
```

Both halves of orion read the two files. The TUI owns most keys; the DAEMON owns
`worktree_base_branch`, `session_idle_timeout`, `prewarm_agents` and `prewarm_sessions`, reads
`custom_harnesses` and `harnesses` beside the TUI (spawn and resume go through them), and reads one
key out of each `projects` entry, `run_command`. Each side
deserializes only its own fields and ignores the rest, and both load
them fresh on every use — so a hand edit applies without restarting either. No key is required: a
missing file is all defaults, an unknown field is skipped, a value this build can't read costs only
that key (it takes its default and stays as stored in the file), and a malformed file is logged and
ignored rather than failing the operation that read it. The overlay patches only the keys it knows
and leaves everything else in the JSON untouched, so hand-written fields survive a save. See
[Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules) for why.

Files beside it in the DATA DIR: `orion.db` (the SQLITE STORE), `config.local.json` (above),
`agent_presets.json` (AGENT PRESETS), `cursor_models.json` (the cached `cursor-agent --list-models` answer, refreshed after 24h),
`ssh_hosts.json` (the SSH HOSTS FILE), `reviewed.json` (REVIEWED MARKS). All but the database are
convenience stores: missing or malformed reads as empty.

## Every setting

Sixty-three keys. **Overlay** is the SETTINGS OVERLAY tab whose row edits the key; `—` means the key
exists only in the file, so it is hand-edit-only. Most rows toggle or cycle on `Enter` / `←` / `→`; a
*typed* row (`worktree_base_branch`, the Project tab's **Run command**) opens a one-line prompt on
`Enter` instead, pre-filled with the stored value, and an empty answer puts its default back. The Agents tab groups its rows under **Quick
prompt**, **Claude**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **Pi**, **Muse**, **Grok Build** and **OpenCode** headers, so a harness's rows read `Enabled` / `Model` /
`Effort` under its name rather than repeating it. The **Project** tab is the one tab whose rows are
not orion's but one project's: the project the grid is scoped to, named with its path on
the tab's first line, and each row there reads and writes that project's own entry under `projects`
— so the same row shows a different value on the next project over. The **Experimental** tab holds
behaviors that change how the tree is worked; every switch there is off by default.

| Key | Type | Default | Overlay | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `palette_enter_attaches` | bool | `true` | General | `Enter` on a PALETTE (`/`) session attaches and focuses the TERMINAL PANE. Off, `Enter` only lands on the card and previews it — except on a session that NEEDS FEEDBACK (the red row), which attaches either way, since the only thing to do with a jump to a question is answer it. `Ctrl+o` / `Ctrl+f` still pick open / focus explicitly either way. The `.` / `,` attention jump lands the same way this setting says, red rows included. |
| `git_init_on_create` | bool | `true` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **git init new projects** (Settings → General): DAEMON-owned, off left a directory the ADD PROJECT BROWSER (`o`) created without a repository, and the add then failed. Every project is a git repository now: a folder the browser creates is always `git init`ed, and opening an existing folder in no repository asks in a CONFIRM DIALOG whether to `git init` it — `y` inits it and opens it, `n` leaves it alone. So nothing reads the key and no tab edits it; the TUI still loads and writes it back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `worktree_base_branch` | string | `""` | General | DAEMON-owned WORKTREE BASE BRANCH: where every new WORKTREE nobody named a base for starts — a bare `orion worktree`, the QUICK PROMPT's auto-created one (`orion worktree --base` always wins). Empty, shown as `auto` in the overlay, is origin's own default branch: `origin/HEAD` freshly fetched, normally `origin/main`. A name — `master`, `develop` — is resolved the way `--base` resolves one: origin is fetched and origin's copy of that branch (`origin/master`) is the start point, untracked, never the checkout's local branch of that name, which is only as new as its last pull; a branch origin lacks that the checkout has locally is used as named. The setting is one name for every project, so a repo with no branch of that name at all does not fail the `n`: it falls back to `origin/HEAD` as if the key were empty, and `daemon.log` says which repo ignored it. A leading `origin/` is dropped (`origin/master` means `master`); a tag or SHA is not a branch and falls back too — name those with `--base`. Typed, not cycled: `Enter` on the row opens a prompt, an empty answer puts `auto` back. |
| `editor` | string | `"vim"` | General | The EDITOR the FILE FINDER (`f`), TREE BROWSER (`b`), find-in-files (`Shift+F`) and ⌥click launch, invoked as `<editor> +<line> <file>`. The overlay cycles `vim`, `nvim`, `nano`, `emacs`, `hx`; any command passes through verbatim, so a hand edit can name one the picker doesn't. `ORION_EDITOR` overrides it for the process. |
| `close_finder_on_open` | bool | `true` | General | Opening a file closes the FILE FINDER behind the editor modal, so quitting the editor is one Esc instead of two. Off leaves the results underneath. Never touches the TREE BROWSER (its editor is its own preview pane) or ⌥click. |
| `ssh_sync_config` | bool | `true` | General | SETTINGS SYNC: `orion ssh` and `orion tunnel` send this machine's `config.json` and AGENT PRESETS along, and the remote orion merges them into its own settings before it starts — so a remote is set up the way this machine is on every connect, without reconfiguring it. Its `config.local.json` still wins there, and its projects, sessions and SSH HOSTS FILE stay its own. `--no-sync-config` leaves the settings behind for one connection. See [Backup, restore and other machines](#backup-restore-and-other-machines). |
| `skip_session_naming` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.30, **Skip starting prompt**: on, new AGENTS launched straight from the NEW SESSION PICKER instead of stopping at a task box first. Every launch now goes through the QUICK PROMPT (`p`, or `n` after its harness pick), whose `Enter` on an empty box starts the CLI bare, so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `confirm_on_archive` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.34, **Confirm on archive**: on, `a` and the row menu's **Archive** asked in a CONFIRM DIALOG before archiving a session; off, the default, archived at once. Every archive asks now, whatever the key says — the dialog names the session and says `u` brings it back — so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `session_idle_timeout` | string | `"5m"` | Sessions | DAEMON-owned IDLE TIMEOUT: how long a session in a WORKTREE no client is viewing goes unwatched before the IDLE REAPER kills its PTY. See the values below. |
| `done_sound` | string | `"Glass"` | Sessions | The DONE SOUND rung when a turn reaches FINISHED: `off`, `bell` (the terminal BEL — silent in Ghostty unless its `bell-features` include `audio`), or a macOS system sound from `/System/Library/Sounds` played with `afplay` (`Glass`, `Ping`, `Pop`, `Hero`, …). Over `orion ssh` and off macOS it is always the bell. |
| `feedback_sound` | string | `"Sosumi"` | Sessions | The FEEDBACK SOUND rung when a turn stops at NEEDS FEEDBACK — a permission prompt or a question — with the same values and fallbacks as `done_sound`, and a different default so red and green sound different from the next room. It never rings for the session whose pane you are locked into typing at while the terminal window has focus: that prompt is already under your hands. The one switch for the DESKTOP NOTIFICATION too: while the terminal window is in the background (from the focus reports orion asks the terminal for — tmux needs `focus-events on`), each session that goes red is also named in a desktop notification (`osascript` on macOS, `notify-send` on Linux; never over `orion ssh`, where the desktop is the wrong machine's; a notifier that is missing or fails is a debug line, not an error). `off` silences the sound and the notification together. |
| `preset_text` | string | `"prefix"` | Sessions | PRESET TEXT: which side of the task a new AGENT PRESET's text goes — `prefix` (one box, sent before the task), `postfix` (one box, sent after it) or `prefix & postfix` (both, the form every preset had through 0.32). The PRESET EDITOR opens a new preset with the box(es) named here, and its **Text** row changes one preset — a side the row leaves out saves blank; editing a stored preset also shows any side that already holds text, so nothing saved is ever hidden. Prefix alone by default: the framing most people reach for, and one box to fill. A hand-edited `both` reads as `prefix & postfix`; anything else as the default. See [Sessions](sessions.md#agent-presets). |
| `delete_empty_worktree` | bool | `false` | Sessions | DELETE EMPTIED WORKTREE: what the delete of a linked WORKTREE's last live card asks — the last session's `d`, the last terminal's close, or a `D` that takes them all. Off, the default, that card's own CONFIRM DIALOG carries the question too, before anything is deleted (`Delete agent 'x'? Its session and history go away.` then `Nothing else is left in worktree 'feature': delete it from disk too?`), with three answers: `Enter` or `y` deletes the card and then the worktree, the same forced delete the band's own `d` runs; `n` deletes the card and keeps the empty checkout; `Esc` cancels and keeps the card alive. On, the question is not asked: the dialog is the card's ordinary two-way confirm, its message saying the worktree goes with it, and `Enter` deletes both — unless archived sessions are still filed under the checkout, whose history the delete would take: those always get the three-way question, which says how many go with it. The ROOT WORKTREE is never offered either way, and archiving a session (`a`) never counts as emptying: an archived card is still filed under its checkout. With `show_all_worktrees` on, off asks nothing — the emptied worktree keeps its band — and on still deletes the worktree with its last card. See [Sessions](sessions.md#the-grid). |
| `show_all_worktrees` | bool | `true` | Sessions | SHOW ALL WORKTREES: every checkout of the project gets a BAND on the grid, one with nothing running in it too. It is on by default. Off, the grid is only what is running: a checkout with no session or terminal has no band. On, such a checkout is an EMPTY BAND — its rule over one line, `nothing running · p: new session · t: terminal · d: delete worktree` — which `j`/`k` walk onto, where `p`/`n`/`t` start work, and where `d` (or **Delete worktree** in its right-click menu) deletes the worktree behind its own confirm (`Delete worktree 'feature' from disk?`); the ROOT WORKTREE's band has no `d`. On also means deleting a worktree's last card never asks about the worktree, so the emptied band stays until its own `d` — unless `delete_empty_worktree` is on, which still deletes the worktree with its last card. The ARCHIVED VIEW never shows an empty band. See [Sessions](sessions.md#the-grid). |
| `theme` | string | `"default"` | Appearance | The THEME: `default`, `ocean`, `forest`, `rose`, `amber`, `lavender`, `coral`, `slate`, `sand`, `mono`. An unknown name falls back to `default`. |
| `animations` | bool | `true` | Appearance | Master switch for the STATUS SWEEP (running and needs-feedback rows for as long as they last; an unread finish and a just-merged checkout for about five seconds) and the SPLASH's motion. Off trades them for fewer repaints on a constrained machine. |
| `focus_tint` | bool | `true` | — (retired) | Through 0.34, **Focused panel tint**: whether the FOCUSED PANEL TINT — the faint accent wash behind whatever keys land in, the card under the cursor while the grid has them and the session pane while it does — was painted at all. It always is now: the wash is the one cue that says which surface keys land in (the cursor's card itself now wears a heavy accent frame over the selection fill instead — brighter while the grid has the keys, a shade darker while the pane does — so the grid still names the session the pane reads), so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `show_workspaces` | bool | `true` | — (retired) | Through 0.33, **Workspaces bar** (Settings → Appearance): whether the bar of WORKSPACE tabs was drawn across the top. Workspaces are gone — every project is in the one list the PROJECT TABS open from — so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `black_background` | bool | `true` | Appearance | BLACK BACKGROUND: paint the whole window pure black — grid, cards, session pane, overlays — instead of leaving it on the terminal's own background (a dark gray in a stock Ghostty). Only cells nothing else colored change: selection fills, the FOCUSED PANEL TINT and the colors a session draws itself sit on top as before. Off keeps the terminal's background, transparency or image included. |
| `hide_card_marks` | bool | `false` | Appearance | **Card marks** (`shown` / `hidden`): leave the `▶` (a RUN TERMINAL) and the `❯` (a plain shell) off the front of each terminal card's name on the GRID, and the `›` off the front of each session card's last prompt, so the name or prompt starts where the mark was. The pane's title still shows the terminal glyph. Off keeps them. A config written under the old key, `hide_terminal_glyphs`, still reads. |
| `highlight_current_card` | bool | `true` | Appearance | **Highlight current card** (`on` / `off`): the card under the cursor on the GRID, the one the pane reads, trades its gray fill for a very faint wash of the colour its frame would have unselected (red asking, yellow running, blue finished and unread). The wash breathes slowly while the card has something going on; a quiet card or a terminal gets a still, faint accent wash, as every card does with the animations off. It stays lit while you type in the pane and fades further when the PROJECT TABS have the keys. Off keeps the plain gray fill, dimmed whenever the keys leave the grid. |
| `session_pane` | string | `"right"` | Appearance | Where the PANE that reads the card under the cursor sits: `right` (down the right of the cards, full height, half the width until its edge is dragged) or `bottom` (under the GRID, full width). The SIDE BUTTON just before the `×` on the pane's header flips it in one click — `⬓` down the right, `◨` along the bottom — and writes this same key. Its edge facing the cards is dragged the same way on both sides — a `┃` grip beside the cards, a `━` grip under them — and the width and the height are remembered apart, so switching sides never turns one into the other. A window too narrow for the pane and a column of cards side by side lays it out along the bottom until there is room (and draws no side button). Anything off the list — `left` from older builds included — reads as `right`. |
| `worktree_layout` | string | `"cards"` | Appearance | How the GRID lays out each worktree's band: `cards` (a row of cards under the band's rule) or `list` (a compact list — every session and terminal one line under the rule, stacked: its status dot and name, what it runs on, and its last prompt or the shell's last line, with how long since it moved at the right). A band in the list starts collapsed, showing only its 3 most recent sessions — plus the one the cursor is on, wherever it sits — and a `▾ 2 more · Tab: see all 5` line under them; `Tab` (or a click on that line) opens the band to every entry, and `Tab` or `Esc` folds it back. `j`/`k` walk the lines as one column across the bands. Anything off the list reads as `cards`. |
| `expand_all_worktrees` | bool | `false` | Appearance | **Expand all worktrees** (`on` / `off`): lay every band on the GRID out open at once — each worktree's sessions and terminals wrapped into rows under its rule (in the `list` layout, every entry listed) — instead of one band opened at a time with `Tab`. With it on there is no accordion: `Tab` and a second click on a band's rule open and fold nothing (the footer says so), and `j`/`k` walk down every worktree's rows as one column. The band `Tab` last opened is kept and is open again once this is off. |
| `hide_card_prompt` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.40, **Card prompt** (Settings → Appearance, `shown` / `hidden`): `hidden` left the last prompt off every session card on the GRID. Every card shows it now, so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `card_issue_number` | bool | `true` | Appearance | Show the `#15` of the GitHub issue a session was started from (an issue session, launched out of the issues modal) at the right end of its card on the GRID (**Card issue number**, `on` / `off`). The number is a link: a click lands the cursor on the card and opens the issue in the browser, as `⇧I` does. Cards not started from an issue are unchanged. |
| `hide_draft_prs` | bool | `false` | Appearance | Leave draft pull requests out of the grid's PR & ISSUE COUNTS and the PALETTE's (`/`) pull-request rows, so browsing what's open shows only the rows asking for a reviewer; the PULL REQUESTS MODAL lists drafts either way. A view filter, not a fetch filter: the open-list lookup still fetches the drafts and the PR CACHE still holds them, so `shown` brings them back at once and a draft marked ready joins the rows on the refresh that says so. Sessions and the pull request under their cards are never hidden. |
| `card_line_changes` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Card line counts** (Settings → Appearance): on, each GRID card followed its checkout's changed-file count with the lines behind it. Every card does now — `↳ feat +3 files +120 -45`, the added in the DIFF VIEWER's green and the removed in its red, counted as the DIFF VIEWER shows them (tracked files against HEAD, staged or not, and every line of an untracked file as added; a binary file, or an untracked one over 1 MiB, adds nothing) by one `git diff --numstat` beside each `git status` the file count already runs; on a narrow card the word `files` goes first, then the lines, before the branch gives up a letter — so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `projects` | object | `{}` | Project | PROJECT SETTINGS: one entry per project set up differently from the rest, keyed by the project's repo path exactly as the DAEMON stores it, holding that project's rows from the **Project** tab — `{"projects": {"/Users/me/src/app": {"run_command": "npm run dev", "open_command": "open http://localhost:3000"}}}`. Two rows: **Run command** (`run_command`, string, default `""`) is the RUN COMMAND **Run** (a card's or the project tab's right-click menu) starts in *that project's* worktrees — the same shell line a `.orion.json` `run` would carry, and the way to set one without committing a file; while it is set, **Run** runs it and never opens the file, and empty (shown as `.orion.json`) hands the decision back to the checkout's PROJECT FILE, so a project that has one needs nothing here. Typed, not cycled: `Enter` opens a prompt titled with the project, an empty answer puts `.orion.json` back. The DAEMON reads it fresh at each **Run**. **Open command** (`open_command`, string, default `""`) is its twin for the OPEN COMMAND `Shift+Enter` / `Shift+O` fires on that project's worktrees — `open http://localhost:3000`, say — with the same precedence over the file's `open` and the same prompt; the TUI reads it fresh at each press, since it runs on the machine you are sitting at. The tab edits the selected project and names it on its first line; with no project in the tree its rows read `n/a`. A project with no entry reads as the defaults (an empty command in each row), and an entry that only repeats them is dropped on save, so the map names only the projects that differ; an empty `run_command` or `open_command` is left out of an entry rather than written; a key inside an entry this build doesn't know — the retired `hide_root_worktree` an older build wrote among them — is carried through a save. To the file's rules the map is one key: a value in it this build can't read costs the whole map, not one project. |
| `hide_root_worktree` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.27 one switch for every project (**Hide root worktree**, Settings → Experimental), then through 0.35 the fallback for a project whose `projects` entry had no **Hide root worktree** row of its own: on, that project's ROOT WORKTREE was left out of everything the grid launched into. The root is always listed now — a launch that must not land in the shared checkout cuts a fresh worktree instead (`^N` in the QUICK PROMPT, or `quick_prompt_new_worktree`) — so this build never reads the key, here or inside an entry, and no tab edits it; both are still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `hide_projects` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Projects panel** (Settings → Appearance): on, the Projects panel of the old three-panel layout started collapsed to its rail. The GRID has no panels, so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `hide_worktrees` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Worktrees panel**: the same switch for the Worktrees panel. Never read, no row, loaded and written back as stored. |
| `hide_sessions` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Sessions panel**: the same switch for the Sessions panel. Never read, no row, loaded and written back as stored. |
| `recent_prompts` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Recent prompts** (Settings → Experimental): on, a session's last prompts were listed under its row. Every card carries its session's newest prompt now, whatever the key says, so this build never reads it and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `recent_prompts_count` | integer | `3` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Recent prompts shown**: how many of those prompts that build listed, `1` to `5`. Never read, no row, loaded and written back as stored. |
| `show_key_combos` | bool | `false` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **Key combo display** (Settings → Experimental): on, each key pressed on the grid was spelled at the bottom left of the screen with what it did. The KEY COMBO DISPLAY is always on now, whatever the key says — every press shows, `j - Move down`, and clears itself three seconds on ([Keys](keys.md#chips-and-readouts)) — so this build never reads it and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `remember_harness` | bool | `false` | Experimental | REMEMBER HARNESS: a launch walked through the NEW SESSION PICKER (`n`), the PR SESSION picker or the QUICK PROMPT's `Tab` picker makes its harness the default the next launch starts on — the picker opens on that row and `p` launches it — and a model or effort drilled into through the submenus becomes that harness's own Model / Effort default. It writes the Agents tab's own rows (`quick_prompt_kind`, `<kind>_model`, `<kind>_effort`), so the tab always shows what the next launch will be; a pick that already is the default writes nothing, and an AGENT PRESET launch changes nothing, its harness being the preset's. Off, a pick is one session's: the NEW SESSION PICKER keeps opening on the `quick_prompt_kind` harness and the PR SESSION picker on its first row. See [Sessions](sessions.md#the-new-session-picker). |
| `pr_issue_counts` | bool | `true` | — (retired) | Through 0.37, **PR & issue counts** (Settings → Experimental): off, the GRID's header dropped the `3 prs · 2 issues` beside the session count and the other projects' issues were never swept. The header always counts now — what is waiting on a repo is read off it without opening `v` or `i`, a click on either count opens that list, a count is left out until its list has landed, and a list cut off at the fetch cap counts `100+` — so this build never reads the key and no tab edits it; it is still loaded and written back as stored for an older orion sharing the file ([Compatibility rules](#compatibility-rules)). |
| `quick_prompt_kind` | string | `"claude"` | Agents | Which AGENT KIND the QUICK PROMPT (`p`) launches: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `pi`, `muse`, `grok` or `opencode`. Its model and effort come from that kind's own defaults below, so this is one name, not a third pair. A kind switched off here is stepped around. The NEW SESSION PICKER opens on it too, and with **Remember harness** on (Experimental) every picker-walked launch rewrites it. |
| `quick_prompt_focus` | bool | `false` | Agents | QUICK PROMPT FOCUS: whether a QUICK PROMPT launch enters and locks the new session's TERMINAL PANE. Off, the keys stay on the grid, and where the cursor goes is `follow_new_session`'s. On, it outranks that key: a launch that enters the new session's pane has to go there. Only the QUICK PROMPT reads it — every other launch takes the pane. |
| `follow_new_session` | bool | `true` | Agents | FOLLOW NEW SESSION (**Follow new**): a QUICK PROMPT launch lands the cursor on the new session's card — the grid scrolls to keep it on screen and the pane shows it, the keys still on the grid — so a run of launches can be watched going up. It selects the card and no more: entering its terminal is `quick_prompt_focus`'s. It covers every QUICK PROMPT: `p`, `n`'s box, `Shift+P` on a card, and the boxes the ISSUES MODAL and the PULL REQUESTS MODAL open. Off, the cursor, the pane and the keys stay on the card you were on while the new session's card goes up in its band — first in it, stand-in rows first for a launch that cuts a fresh worktree — and the footer names the branch it went to (`started a session in feat`): the BACKGROUND LAUNCH's stillness, in the project on screen. A launch with no card under the cursor — the aim let go with `Esc`, an empty band, an empty grid — has nothing to keep and lands on its new card either way; so does every launch while `quick_prompt_focus` is on. Terminals (`t`) always come up in the pane. |
| `quick_prompt_new_worktree` | bool | `false` | Agents | QUICK PROMPT NEW WORKTREE: whether each new QUICK PROMPT starts aimed at a fresh worktree (a random branch off the **Worktree base branch**) instead of the checkout under the grid's cursor. `Ctrl+N` in the box flips only that box; the next one starts from this again. Off by default, so `p` starts in the checkout under the cursor — the worktree whose band is selected, or the one the grid is inside — and on the project's root branch with nothing selected (`Esc` off the band). |
| `claude_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE. Off leaves Claude out of the NEW SESSION PICKER and the PR SESSION picker, and skips the standing PREWARM POOL slot; existing sessions keep attaching and resuming. The last kind left on cannot be switched off. |
| `codex_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE for Codex, same rules. |
| `cursor_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE for Cursor, same rules. |
| `pi_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE for Pi, same rules. |
| `muse_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE for Muse, same rules. Muse has no managed hooks yet, so its status stays process-based (running while the PTY is live, no waiting-on-you detection). |
| `opencode_enabled` | bool | `true` | Agents | HARNESS TOGGLE for OpenCode, same rules. |
| `hide_uninstalled_harnesses` | bool | `false` | Agents | When on, the NEW SESSION PICKER lists only enabled harnesses whose CLI is found on PATH. Off by default: a login shell can see CLIs a plain PATH lookup misses, and the daemon re-checks through the login shell at launch anyway. |
| `claude_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--model` for new Claude sessions. The literal `"default"` is the sentinel meaning *don't pass the flag, let the CLI pick* — it is what you see in a fresh file, not a missing value. Overlay list: `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` — unless `claude_models` below or Claude Code's own `availableModels` allowlist replaces it; any other string is passed through verbatim. |
| `claude_models` | array of strings | `[]` | — (hand-edited) | The Claude model rows every picker offers (the NEW SESSION PICKER and QUICK PROMPT submenus, the AGENTS TAB, the PRESET EDITOR) in place of the built-in aliases, verbatim, `"default"` always first: `["claude-sonnet-5", "us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-v1:0"]`. For an organization that restricts models (Claude Code refuses `--model sonnet` with *Model "sonnet" is restricted by your organization's settings. Using claude-sonnet-5 instead.*) or a provider whose ids the aliases don't reach (Bedrock, Vertex, a gateway; on Bedrock `sonnet` even means Sonnet 4.5). Empty, the list follows Claude Code's `availableModels` when one is on disk — `~/.claude/remote-settings.json` (server-managed cache), the macOS MDM profile, `managed-settings.json` and `managed-settings.d/` in the system directory, then `~/.claude/settings.json`, read once at TUI start — else the aliases. A hand edit here applies without a restart. |
| `claude_effort` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default reasoning effort (`--effort`) for new Claude sessions: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or the `"default"` sentinel. |
| `codex_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--model` for new Codex sessions (Codex spells the flag the same way Claude does): `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`, or the `"default"` sentinel. |
| `codex_effort` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `-c model_reasoning_effort=` for new Codex sessions: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or the `"default"` sentinel. |
| `cursor_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default model *family* for new Cursor sessions, from the cached catalogue (`cursor_models.json`), or the `"default"` sentinel. |
| `cursor_effort` | string | `"default"` | Agents | The effort suffix the DAEMON joins onto `cursor_model` into one flat `--model <family>-<effort>` id. The choices follow the family, so the overlay row reads `n/a` while the model is unset or has no effort variants. |
| `pi_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--model` for new Pi sessions. Pi takes a fuzzy pattern across every provider it has credentials for, so the overlay lists families (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `gpt-5.5`); a hand-edited `provider/id` such as `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` passes through verbatim. |
| `pi_effort` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--thinking` level for new Pi sessions: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or the `"default"` sentinel. |
| `muse_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--model` for new Muse sessions. Any model id passes through verbatim; `"default"` means don't pass the flag. |
| `muse_effort` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Reserved until the `muse` CLI documents a reasoning flag. Stored, never sent. |
| `opencode_model` | string | `"default"` | Agents | Default `--model` for new OpenCode sessions: a `provider/model` id passed verbatim (`opencode models` lists what your machine has credentials for). The overlay lists a few well-known ids (`opencode/big-pickle`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, …); a hand-edited one passes through. `"default"` means don't pass the flag, so OpenCode opens on its own last-picked model. There is no `opencode_effort`: OpenCode has no effort flag (reasoning is a per-model variant picked inside its TUI), so its Agents section has no Effort row. |
| `custom_harnesses` | array | `[]` | Agents | Extra CLIs the NEW SESSION PICKER offers after the built-ins, each with its own Agents tab section (Enabled and Model rows). Each entry is `{id, program}` plus options: `label` (picker text, defaults to the id), `enabled` (default `true`), `model` (default `"default"` = the CLI's pick, else passed verbatim), `model_flag` (default `"--model"`), and `hooks` (a built-in dialect the program speaks: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `pi` or `opencode` — with one set the sessions report status, prompts and permission waits exactly like that harness, including title sync and auto-title for `claude`; without one they stay process-based, running while the PTY is live and never waiting-on-you). Ids use lowercase letters, digits and hyphens and must not collide with a built-in. Legacy: new harnesses belong in `harnesses`, where they also gain resume, effort, system-prompt and hook-dialect rows. Invalid entries never launch — the picker hides them and the daemon refuses them with the reason. |
| `harnesses` | object | `{}` | Agents | The harness registry: per-harness deltas over the compiled-in known harnesses (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Pi, Muse, Grok Build, OpenCode), and whole new third-party CLIs. The Agents tab grows one section per entry — Enabled, Model, and Effort rows while the harness offers effort — and the `n` picker, `e` presets, spawn, resume and hooks all read the merged rows. A hand edit that breaks one entry refuses its launches with the reason, never the whole file. Run `orion config harnesses` to print the effective rows to copy from. |
| `keybindings` | object | `{}` | Hotkeys | KEYMAP overrides, keyed by action id, valued with a comma-separated chord list: `{"git_diff": "ctrl+g, g"}`. An empty string deliberately unbinds; unknown ids are ignored. Only rows that differ from the defaults are written. |
| `prewarm_agents` | bool | `true` | Sessions | DAEMON-owned PREWARM POOL: keep one booted agent CLI standing by in the selected WORKTREE, so creating a session there adopts it and feels instant. **Costs one idle CLI process per warm slot** (150–300 MB each, up to 15 minutes), and that spare is a real session as far as the CLI is concerned — Claude's own `/list-agents` lists it beside the sessions you made, named after the directory (`my-repo-3f`), and the memory modal (`Shift+M`) groups it under **warm spares**. Off drains the pool on the DAEMON's next sweep (within 30 s). |
| `prewarm_sessions` | bool | `true` | Sessions | DAEMON-owned SESSION PREWARM: boot a WORKTREE's dead sessions when your selection rests on it, so attaching shows an already-booted screen instead of a booting shell. **Costs idle shell/CLI processes for sessions you may never open.** Off — for a machine with less memory to spare — landing on a worktree boots nothing: a session forks only when your cursor lands on its row or you attach to it, one at a time; sessions already up stay until the IDLE REAPER takes them. |

### Prewarming

`prewarm_agents` and `prewarm_sessions` are the two settings that cost real processes you never
asked for, so they are worth knowing about on a laptop or a small remote box — and worth knowing
about if your sessions talk to each other. A warm spare is a bare `claude` sitting at its prompt in
the selected worktree: Claude's `/list-agents` shows it as a peer named after the directory, the
same way it names any session you have not titled yet, so a spare beside a fresh untitled session
reads as two copies of one session (`my-repo-3f`, `my-repo-a1`), one of them forever idle. That is
the spare, not a duplicate — `Shift+M` lists it under **warm spares** with its PID. Both rows live on
the SETTINGS OVERLAY's Sessions tab (`Warm spare agent`, `Prewarm dead sessions`); the same keys in
CONFIG.JSON work by hand:

```json
{ "prewarm_agents": false, "prewarm_sessions": false }
```

Turning the pool off takes the standing spares away on the DAEMON's next sweep. `session_idle_timeout`
is what bounds the cost of both when they are left on.

### The harness registry

The seven known harnesses ship compiled in, and `harnesses` edits them per field — or adds a new
CLI outright. Only your deltas go in the file; `orion config harnesses` prints the effective rows
to copy from. Disabling one is one line, and adding a CLI is one block: picker, presets, spawn,
resume, hooks and the Agents tab section all follow, with no rebuild.

```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "cursor": { "enabled": false },
    "agy": {
      "program": "agy",
      "model_default": "big-1",
      "resume_flag": "--resume",
      "hooks": "claude"
    }
  }
}
```

Nullable rows (`program`, `model_flag`, `permissions_flag`, `hooks`, …) clear with `null` —
`"claude": {"hooks": null}` runs Claude with process-based status and no title sync. A row that
stops making sense (an empty program, a resume flag plus a resume subcommand, an unknown dialect)
refuses its launches with the reason while every other harness keeps working. The per-harness keys
the Agents tab edits (`claude_model`, `codex_enabled`, …) keep working as a fallback wherever the
map stays silent. Omit the map entirely and you get every built-in, enabled, with its defaults —
including ones a later orion adds. Like every other object key, a `harnesses` map in
`config.local.json` replaces the whole map from `config.json` rather than merging per harness,
so keep machine-specific overrides in one layer.

Grok Build is enabled by default and launches `grok`. Its Enabled toggle is stored under
`harnesses.grok.enabled`. Set `harnesses.grok.model_default` and `effort_default` in config.json
to pass `--model` and `--reasoning-effort`; unset values use the CLI defaults. The picker offers
only `default` unless you configure `models` and `efforts` lists in that same block.
`--rules` carries additional system guidance and `--resume` accepts a stored session ID, but
automatic session-ID capture and managed hooks are not yet supported. Status is process-based.

### What `session_idle_timeout` accepts

The overlay cycles `off`, `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, but the DAEMON parses more than that: any
`<n>s` / `<n>m` / `<n>h` works, and **`"off"` (or `"0"`) disables reaping entirely**. A malformed
value falls back to the 5m default, *not* to off — a typo makes reaping ordinary, not absent.

The IDLE REAPER sweeps every 15s and only takes sessions in WORKTREES no client is viewing. RUNNING
and NEEDS FEEDBACK agents, agents whose backgrounded tool call is still running (a Claude
`run_in_background` Bash call or Monitor watch, a Codex shell command — the idle clock restarts when
that job ends), and terminals with a command running, are spared. A reaped session revives on the
next ATTACH or prewarm, and an agent RESUMES its conversation there.

## What the settings overlay owns

- **Settings live in one JSON file** (`config.json`, beside the database, with `config.local.json` over
  it), read fresh on each use by both the daemon and the TUI, so hand edits apply without a restart. `s` opens the settings overlay over the
  same file: color theme, animations, which side of the cards the session pane sits on
  (`session_pane`), whether each worktree is a row of cards or a compact list (`worktree_layout`), whether every worktree is open at once (`expand_all_worktrees`),
  editor, the branch new worktrees start from (`worktree_base_branch`: `auto` for origin's default
  branch, or a name such as `master`, typed into a prompt that `Enter` opens on the row), which
  agent CLIs the new-session menu offers (at least one stays on) and their default model
  and reasoning effort, the selected project's own settings on the **Project** tab (`projects`,
  keyed by repo path — its run and open commands), the idle timeout, whether a warm spare and a worktree's dead sessions are
  pre-booted (`prewarm_agents`, `prewarm_sessions`), the done sound (`done_sound`: a ding
  when a turn finishes — a macOS system sound such as `Glass`, the default; `bell` for the terminal
  bell, which Ghostty keeps silent unless its `bell-features` include `audio`; or `off`. Over
  `orion ssh` and off macOS it is always the bell), the feedback sound (`feedback_sound`: the same
  choices, `Sosumi` by default, rung when a turn stops to ask you — and, while the terminal window
  is in the background, a desktop notification naming the session and its worktree; `off` silences
  both), and which side of the task a new AGENT PRESET's text goes (`preset_text`: `prefix`, the
  default, `postfix` or `prefix & postfix`). `R` inside the overlay puts every setting —
  hotkeys included — back to its default, after a confirmation, and removes `config.local.json`.
  A row that shipped in the last seven days reads `(new)` before its label.
- **Every grid key is rebindable.** The overlay's Hotkeys tab lists every action and what it answers to,
  and writes overrides into the same file (`"keybindings": {"git_diff": "ctrl+g, g"}`); an empty value
  unbinds. Because orion is always a guest inside Terminal.app / Ghostty / tmux, the tab says at bind
  time when a chord probably won't survive the trip — `⌘` anything, `^⇧` without the kitty protocol,
  `^←` on stock macOS. `Ctrl+q` is the one exception to all of it: it unlocks a terminal no matter what
  you bind, since unbinding your way out would trap you in the session.

## Backup, restore and other machines

```sh
orion config path                  # where each settings file is
orion config export ~/backups      # write ~/backups/orion-settings.json
orion config import ~/backups      # merge it back in, here or on a new machine
```

A SETTINGS BUNDLE is one JSON file holding `config.json`, `agent_presets.json` and `ssh_hosts.json`,
each exactly as the file has it, under a marker key:

```json
{
  "orion_bundle": 1,
  "exported_by": "0.27.0",
  "config": { "theme": "ocean", "keybindings": { "git_diff": "ctrl+g" } },
  "agent_presets": [{ "name": "reviewer", "kind": "claude", "prefix": "Be strict." }],
  "ssh_hosts": [{ "host": "me@box", "last_used_ms": 1789400000000 }]
}
```

- **Export** writes to stdout, to a file, or to `orion-settings.json` inside a folder you name. It
  never carries `config.local.json`, the database, the logs or the PR and model caches.
- **Import** takes an export, a bare `config.json`, `agent_presets.json` or `ssh_hosts.json`, a folder
  holding any of them (a dotfiles folder, a copy of an old data dir), or `-` for stdin. It merges
  rather than replaces: keys the file sets replace this machine's and keys it lacks are left alone,
  presets merge by name, and hosts merge by destination, keeping the most recent. `config.local.json`
  is never written, and the summary names any imported key it still overrides. A settings file that
  exists but can't be read fails the import before anything is written. Changes apply without a
  restart.
- **Copying the file works too.** Both halves re-read `config.json` on every use, so a backup copied
  over it — or to wherever `ORION_CONFIG_FILE` points — applies at once, with no import and no
  restart.
- **Over ssh** (`ssh_sync_config`, on by default), `orion ssh` and `orion tunnel` export
  `config.json` and the presets into the one ssh command they already run, and the remote orion
  imports them before it starts, saying what changed on stderr. Sync is one way: the machine you
  connect from wins key by key on each connect, so a setting the remote should keep goes in the
  remote's `config.local.json`. A remote orion too old to know about the bundle ignores it and starts
  as before. The bundle travels base64-encoded in the remote command, so that machine's process list
  shows it while ssh starts. Settings hold no credentials, but a preset's prefix text travels too.
  A bundle over 64 KiB is not sent (a real one is a few KiB), and the connection goes ahead without
  it.

### Compatibility rules

Two orion versions share these files all the time: a remote a few releases behind the machine that
connects to it, a backup restored into a newer build. Every setting follows these rules so neither
version breaks the other:

1. **Keys are only ever added.** A released key keeps its name, its type and its meaning. A new
   meaning gets a new key, and orion keeps reading and writing the old one for older builds. A
   key renamed with its row (`hide_terminal_glyphs` became `hide_card_marks` in 0.40) is read under
   both names and written back under the new one alone, so a build older than the rename sees that
   one setting at its default.
2. **Missing means default; unknown is kept.** A key a file lacks is its default. A key a build
   doesn't know is ignored when read and written back untouched on save; the overlay's `R` reset is
   the one thing that drops it.
3. **One bad value costs one key.** A value a build can't read takes its default in that build, is
   logged, and stays as stored unless that setting is changed on that machine. Preset and host
   entries work the same way: one this build can't read, such as a preset for a harness a newer
   orion added, is kept through a save rather than deleted.
4. **Choices fall back when used, not when read.** Values like `theme` and `quick_prompt_kind` stay
   plain strings, and a name a build doesn't know falls back to the default where it is used.
5. **Old files are tested.** `crates/orion-core/fixtures/config-<version>.json` holds every key a
   release wrote, each set to something other than its default, and the test suite checks that every
   one still loads as written and survives a save. Each release adds its own fixture.

`config.json` carries no version number. An older build could only refuse a newer file or ignore the
number, and the keys a file holds already tell a newer build everything it needs. The bundle's
`orion_bundle` marks the file and never gates it: sections are only ever added, and a reader leaves
one it doesn't know alone.

## The project file (`.orion.json`)

The PROJECT FILE tells orion how a repository is run. Commit it at the repo root, beside
`package.json` or `Cargo.toml`, and every checkout of the project carries it:

```json
{
  "run": "npm run dev",
  "open": "open http://localhost:3000"
}
```

Both keys are optional shell command lines, and both run in the selected worktree's checkout:

- **`run`** — the RUN COMMAND. **Run** in a card's right-click menu (or the project tab's) starts it;
  the same row, now **Stop run**, stops it. The DAEMON runs it in a RUN TERMINAL: your login shell
  (`$SHELL -l -i -c`, the wrapper an agent launch uses, so `npm`, `bun` or `mise` resolve the way they
  do typed) running that line and nothing else. Its process is the worktree's RUNNING state — it is a
  terminal card in the worktree's band, its `▶` green while the process lives, showing the run's last
  lines like any terminal card. Like every session it outlives
  the TUI and every client sees it, and the idle reaper never takes it. Stopping kills the whole process
  tree and removes the row. A command that exits on its own leaves its row behind, dimmed; attaching it
  replays how the run ended, and nothing but **Run** runs it again — not an attach, not the prewarm
  sweep. There is one run per worktree: a second client's **Run** on a worktree already running never
  starts another.
- **`open`** — the OPEN COMMAND. `Shift+Enter` on a worktree fires it once, from the TUI rather than
  the DAEMON, since what it opens — a browser tab, an editor — belongs on the machine you are sitting
  at. It runs through `$SHELL -c` with its output discarded, and orion does not wait for it. The key
  answers from any card: the worktree is the one whose band the cursor is on.
  `Shift+Enter` needs the KITTY PROTOCOL (Ghostty, kitty); Terminal.app sends it as a plain `Enter` and
  tmux flattens it to one, so `Shift+O` and `Alt+Enter` (the `ESC` `CR` a mapped Shift+Enter sends, which
  tmux passes through) are bound beside it, and a card's right-click menu has **Open**. See
  [Keys](keys.md#full-keymap) for teaching Terminal.app the real key.

The file is read fresh at every press, so an edit applies on the next **Run** or `Shift+Enter`. Orion looks
in the worktree's own checkout first, so a branch can carry commands of its own, and falls back to the
project's main checkout, so a worktree cut before the file was committed still runs. The first file found
is the whole answer: a worktree's file with no `open` does not borrow the main checkout's. A missing
file, a missing key, or JSON that doesn't parse is a one-line footer message saying what to fix; unknown
keys are ignored.

Both commands have a second home: **Run command** and **Open command** on the SETTINGS OVERLAY's
Project tab (`s`), which keep them in `config.json` under the project's `projects` entry instead of in
the repository — for a project you would rather not commit a file to, or one whose commands are yours
alone. Set, the row is what **Run** runs, or `Shift+Enter` opens, in every worktree of that project, and the
file is not consulted for that command; empty, the file decides as above. They are one project's
settings, so each project can run and open its own way, and the footer names both places when neither
has the command. See `projects` in [Every setting](#every-setting).

Unlike the WORKTREE HOOKS below, which orion runs on its own and so never takes from a checkout,
nothing in the PROJECT FILE runs until you press its key on that worktree — the same trust as typing the
command into a shell there.

## Worktree hooks

A checkout often owns things outside its own directory — a dev-server port, a Caddy or nginx route, a
docker compose project, a database — that orion knows nothing about. WORKTREE HOOKS are two
executables of yours the DAEMON runs after it creates or deletes a worktree, so a project can provision
and release those itself. They are the one setting that is not in CONFIG.JSON: a hook is per
repository, so it lives in git config, read fresh at each use:

```sh
git config orion.worktreeCreateHook /absolute/path/to/worktree-setup
git config orion.worktreeDeleteHook /absolute/path/to/worktree-cleanup
```

Git resolves the key the usual way, so `git config --global` sets one script for every project and a
repo's own `.git/config` overrides it. Orion never reads a hook from a file inside the checkout — a
committed hook would run whatever a clone brought with it, which is why git refuses working-tree hooks
too. Keep the executable outside the worktrees it serves; the delete hook runs after its checkout is
gone.

What a hook gets:

- **Two arguments**, both absolute: the main repository path, then the created or deleted worktree
  path. The value is spawned directly as an executable — no shell — so a space in either path arrives
  intact.
- **The main checkout as its working directory**, since the deleted directory no longer exists.
- **Environment**: `ORION_HOOK` (`worktree-create` or `worktree-delete`, so one script can serve
  both keys), `ORION_WORKTREE_BRANCH` and `ORION_WORKTREE_ID`.

When they run, and what a failure means:

- **Only after a orion operation that succeeded.** The create hook fires once the checkout exists and
  its row is in every client — `orion worktree`, the QUICK PROMPT's fresh
  worktree, a PR SESSION's checkout. The delete hook fires once `git worktree remove` (forced or not)
  and the row drop went through, including a checkout you had already `rm -rf`'d by hand. A delete
  that fails or is cancelled runs nothing. Worktrees created or removed outside orion, which WORKTREE
  SYNC merely notices, run nothing either.
- **Skipped while the directory is still there.** When git had already stopped tracking a checkout
  and orion leaves the untracked directory alone, the delete hook does not run against live files;
  the warning says so.
- **Hooks never overlap.** They run under the DAEMON's worktree lock, so a create of a path waits
  for the delete hook still releasing it, and `Shift+D`'s batch runs its hooks one after another. A
  stuck hook holds the next worktree operation for at most the timeout; keystrokes never wait on it.
- **A hook only reports.** It exits non-zero, cannot start, or runs past the timeout (30 s; then it
  and every process it started are killed) — orion shows a one-line warning naming the hook and the
  last line it wrote to stderr, and logs the tail of its output in `daemon.log`. The worktree stays
  created or deleted, because it already was. Nothing is retried.
- **It may start something that outlives it.** A hook that launches a dev server in the background
  and exits 0 is a success the moment it exits — its output goes to a file, not a pipe, so a child
  holding it open never stalls the wait — and the server is left running. Only a timeout takes down
  what the hook started.
- **The DAEMON's environment is not a login shell.** On macOS a launchd-started daemon has a thin
  `PATH`; a script that calls `caddy` or `docker` sets its own.

A cleanup script in the spirit of the request that introduced this — release a routing entry and a
development slot keyed by the deleted path:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# $1 = main repo, $2 = deleted worktree
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
name=$(basename "$2")
[ -e "$HOME/.config/dev-slots/$name" ] || exit 0
rm -f "$HOME/.config/dev-slots/$name" "/etc/caddy/sites/$name.caddy"
caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

## Logs

`daemon.log` and `tui.log` live in the state dir, which is not the DATA DIR on Linux and *is* on
macOS — the `directories` crate has no state dir there, so orion falls back to `<DATA DIR>/state`:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.orion.orion/state/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/state/orion/`
- With `ORION_DATA_DIR` set, always `$ORION_DATA_DIR/state/`, so a test or a parallel instance keeps
  its logs beside its own data.

`ORION_LOG=debug` for more. No `daemon.log` at all means the DAEMON never started.

## Environment variables

Knobs worth reaching for by hand:

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ORION_LOG` | — | `RUST_LOG`-style tracing filter for both the DAEMON and the TUI. |
| `ORION_EDITOR` | — | Editor command the file modals open, ahead of the `editor` setting. |
| `ORION_CONFIG_FILE` | `<DATA DIR>/config.json` | Moves `config.json` alone — into a dotfiles checkout, say — leaving the database, logs and `config.local.json` in the DATA DIR. Give an absolute or `~/` path. The DAEMON reads it from its own environment, so after changing it run `orion kill` and relaunch. |

Overrides for tests and parallel instances — real, but not things a normal install needs:

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ORION_RUNTIME_DIR` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/orion`, else `/tmp/orion-<uid>` | The RUNTIME DIR holding the DAEMON SOCKET and pidfile. |
| `ORION_DATA_DIR` | the platform app-support dir | The DATA DIR holding the database, config and logs. |
| `ORION_AGENT_CMD` | — | Replaces every agent CLI with one command line, taken verbatim (tests stand in `/bin/sh` or a stub script). |
| `ORION_INSTALL_URL` | the published install script | The URL `orion upgrade` / `orion ssh` fetch. |
| `ORION_UPDATE_CHECK_SECS` | `3600` | How often the TUI asks GitHub whether a newer release is published, for the FOOTER's `⇡ vX.Y.Z` indicator (one `curl` to the release page's redirect, no `gh` token); `0` turns it off. See [Keys](keys.md#chips-and-readouts). |
| `ORION_IDLE_REAP_MS` | `15000` | IDLE REAPER sweep period in ms. This is how often it looks, not how long a session may idle — that is `session_idle_timeout`. |
| `ORION_WORKTREE_SYNC_MS` | `2000` | WORKTREE SYNC probe period in ms: how often the DAEMON reconciles `git worktree list` so worktrees made outside orion appear. |
| `ORION_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | How long a WORKTREE HOOK may run before the DAEMON kills it and warns; tests shorten it. |

`ORION_AGENT_ID`, `ORION_API_URL` and `ORION_API_TOKEN` are set *by* the DAEMON on every agent
PTY (and scrubbed from plain terminals) so hooks can reach the HOOK RECEIVER — never something you
set yourself. `ORION_IMPORT_BUNDLE` is likewise set *by* `orion ssh` and `orion tunnel` in the
remote command: the SETTINGS BUNDLE the remote orion merges at startup and removes from its
environment before it starts anything. For all of these, empty and unset mean the same thing: use the default.
