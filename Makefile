# Dev helpers for working from a checkout. (End users install via install.sh.)
#
# Ways to run code you just wrote:
#   make dev      isolated instance — own daemon, own data; your real sessions untouched
#                 (first run copies your real projects, worktrees and settings in,
#                 so it looks like yours — `make dev-reset` re-copies)
#   make browser  the same isolated instance, served into a browser tab via ttyd
#
# Each checkout gets its own instance, keyed to its path, so the main clone and
# every worktree can run at once without sharing a daemon, a DB, or a port.
# `make dev-ls` shows them all.
#   make install  put it in ~/.cargo/bin for real use (then `make kill` to cut over)
#   make cycle    install + kill + prune + dev in one go — the re-runnable full cutover
#   make prune    drop stale build artifacts (every hash of a crate but the newest KEEP)

# The dev instance is a second, complete orion: its own socket, DB, and
# settings — and one *per checkout*, so the main clone and every worktree can
# run at the same time. Sharing them is worse than a port clash: two checkouts
# on one runtime dir means the second TUI silently attaches to the first's
# daemon and you drive the other checkout's binary, while `dev-prep` below
# SIGTERMs whichever daemon got there first.
#
# The slot is the checkout's directory name plus a hash of its absolute path,
# so two worktrees with the same name in different repos still separate. The
# runtime dir takes the hash alone — it holds a unix socket, and SUN_LEN (104
# bytes on macOS) is not a budget a long worktree name should be spending.

# puts it (orion-core/src/paths.rs); keep the two in step.

build: ## Release build

# The cp+mv two-step is load-bearing on macOS: overwriting the installed
# binary in place reuses its inode, and the kernel's cached code signature
# for that inode no longer matches the new contents — every exec then dies
# with SIGKILL (exit 137). A fresh inode forces signature re-validation.
install: build ## Install to $(PREFIX) — warns if the live daemon is now stale

	$(PREFIX)/orion kill

# Every distinct build configuration gets its own hash under target/: a
# version bump at release re-hashes every workspace crate, and `cargo build`,
# `cargo test`, `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` each hash separately again.
# On macOS every hash also keeps its object files beside the binary
# (`split-debuginfo=unpacked`, the dev default) — ~200MB per build of
# orion_tui alone — and nothing ever removes the old ones: ten days of
# sessions grew target/ to 41GB and filled the disk (2026-08-29). This keeps
# the newest KEEP builds of every crate and drops the rest, under cargo's own
# build lock so it waits for a running build instead of deleting under it.
# An evicted build that was still in use costs one recompile of that crate,
# nothing worse; `make clean` is still the full reset.
prune: ## Drop stale build artifacts — all but the newest KEEP (3) builds of every crate
	python3 scripts/prune-target.py --keep $(KEEP)

# The whole cutover as one command, safe to re-run as often as you like:
# install first, so a build that fails stops here with every session still
# alive; then kill the real daemon (it is now running the old binary — the
# STALE DAEMON NOTE `install` just printed says as much); then `prune`, now
# that the release build just made is the newest and the killed sessions
# hold no build lock; then `dev`, which builds the debug binary and hands the
# terminal to the isolated dev instance. `orion kill` exits 0 and says "no
# orion daemon running" when there is nothing to stop, so the first run on a
# cold machine goes through too. The kill stops every real session — run
# this from a terminal outside orion, not from a session it would take down
# with it. Recipe lines rather than prerequisites so `make -j` cannot
# reorder the four.
