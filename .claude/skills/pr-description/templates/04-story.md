<!-- 04 · Story — one change with a strong why. Numbered sections read top to bottom:

<One sentence that names the problem and the fix together: "X made Y happen; now Z.">

## 1. The problem <a id="1-the-problem"></a>

<Two to four sentences, in the user's words where possible: what they saw, when, why it mattered. No code yet.>

> <Optional: the user's own sentence, quoted.>

## 2. What changed <a id="2-what-changed"></a>

- **<Hook>.** <The new behaviour, the key or command in backticks.>
- **<Hook>.** <…>
- **Unchanged.** <What the user liked and still has.>

## 3. How it looks <a id="3-how-it-looks"></a>

<!-- A before shot too, if the problem was visible: make it a two-column table. -->

## 5. Risk <a id="5-risk"></a>

<!-- Only when the change ADDS A SURFACE — the DAEMON execs a program, opens a socket, route or
     ClientRequest, reads a new config source, writes a file it did not before. One bullet per way
     in: who or what reaches it, what holds it, what does not. The 🔒 row below then rates the
     residue. A PR that adds no surface deletes this subsection. -->
### 🎯 Attack surface <a id="attack-surface"></a>

- **<Way in>.** <Who or what reaches it. Held by: <mitigation>. Not held: <what remains>.>
- **<Way in>.** <…>

**Verdict:** <🟢 Low risk · 🟡 Merge with care · 🔴 Do not merge as-is — pick one, then one clause saying why. The author's own read; the PR REVIEWER SKILL checks it against the diff.>

| | Level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 🔒 **Security & production** | <Low / Medium / High> | <who can reach the new code and what it reaches — a new `ClientRequest`, a hook route, a shell call, a token, a file the DAEMON writes — or "no new surface: <why>"> |
| ⚡ **Performance** | <Low / Medium / High> | <the hot path touched — the TUI draw, the event-loop drain, the PTY byte path, the WORKTREE SYNC tick — or "off every hot path: <why>"> |
| 🧩 **Fit with the codebase** | <Low / Medium / High> | <the existing pattern it follows, or the departure and why> |

**Rollback:** <one line — `git revert <merge>`, plus what the revert does not undo: a PROTOCOL VERSION bump, a migrated store, a pushed branch.>

## 6. Technical overview <a id="6-technical-overview"></a>

- **Mechanism.** <Three or four sentences: the type or flag, who owns the state, what triggers it.>
- **Files.** `crates/<crate>/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>; `crates/<crate>/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>.
- **Why not <the obvious alternative>.** <One or two sentences.>
- **Gate.** <`make ci` green — N tests; or what did not run and why.>

## 7. Notes <a id="7-notes"></a>

- <Merge state, conflicts, upgrade note.>
- Closes #<N>.
