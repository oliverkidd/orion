## 📦 By crate <a id="by-crate"></a>

### 🧱 orion-core

- **<Hook>.** <The type, flag or protocol field, and what it means for the user, one sentence.>

### ⚙ orion-daemon

- **<Hook>.** <What the DAEMON now does, the hook route or mechanism in backticks.>
- **<Hook>.** <…>

### 🖥 orion-tui

- **<Hook>.** <What the user sees, the key in backticks, the panel it lives in.>

### 💻 orion (CLI)

- **<Hook>.** <The subcommand or flag, `orion <sub>`, and what it prints.>

### 📚 docs

- **<Hook>.** <Which of the DOCS PAGES changed.>

## ⚠️ Risk <a id="risk"></a>

<!-- Only when the change ADDS A SURFACE — the DAEMON execs a program, opens a socket, route or
     ClientRequest, reads a new config source, writes a file it did not before. One bullet per way
     in: who or what reaches it, what holds it, what does not. The 🔒 row below then rates the
     residue. A PR that adds no surface deletes this subsection. -->
### 🎯 Attack surface <a id="attack-surface"></a>

- **<Way in>.** <Who or what reaches it. Held by: <mitigation>. Not held: <what remains>.>
- **<Way in>.** <…>

**Verdict:** <🟢 Low risk · 🟡 Merge with care · 🔴 Do not merge as-is — pick one, then one clause saying why. The author's own read; the PR REVIEWER SKILL checks it against the diff.>

| | Level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 🔒 **Security & production** | <Low / Medium / High> | <who can reach the new code and what it reaches — a new `ClientRequest`, a hook route, a shell call, a token, a file the DAEMON writes — or "no new surface: <why>"> |
| ⚡ **Performance** | <Low / Medium / High> | <the hot path touched — the TUI draw, the event-loop drain, the PTY byte path, the WORKTREE SYNC tick — or "off every hot path: <why>"> |
| 🧩 **Fit with the codebase** | <Low / Medium / High> | <the existing pattern it follows, or the departure and why> |

**Rollback:** <one line — `git revert <merge>`, plus what the revert does not undo: a PROTOCOL VERSION bump, a migrated store, a pushed branch.>

## 🔧 Technical overview <a id="technical-overview"></a>

- **orion-core.** `crates/orion-core/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>. <PROTOCOL VERSION N → N+1, or "unchanged".>
- **orion-daemon.** `crates/orion-daemon/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>; `…/<file>.rs` — <clause>.
- **orion-tui.** `crates/orion-tui/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>.
- **orion.** `crates/orion/src/<file>.rs` — <clause>.
- **Not done.** <The approach rejected and why.>
- **Gate.** <`make ci` green — N tests; or what did not run and why.>

## 📝 Notes <a id="notes"></a>

- <Merge state, conflicts.>
- <Upgrade note: `orion kill` first when the PROTOCOL VERSION moved.>
