//! The LAUNCHER VIEW: orion's one screen. PROJECT TABS across the
//! header, and under them a GRID of cards — one per session in the
//! project on screen, most recent first, gathered into a BAND per
//! worktree that wears the checkout's branch and its pull request on its
//! rule — with the session under the cursor live in the PANE beside them
//! ([`split`]). Walking the cards walks the pane, so stepping through the
//! grid reads each session's progress in turn. The QUICK PROMPT launches
//! from here: `⌘P` picks the PROJECT with type-ahead over every one this
//! machine knows, `⌘.` the checkout in it — a fresh worktree its first
//! row — `Tab` the harness, `⌘/` the MODEL and `⌘Y` steps the effort.
//!
//! Nothing here is a second copy of the tree: the list's cursor IS the
//! app's selection (`App::selected_session`), moved through the same
//! jump the `/` PALETTE uses, so every verb that reads the selection —
//! archive, delete, rename, the diff, the context menu — keeps working on
//! the row under the cursor. What lives here is what the view adds: the
//! rows ([`rows`]), where a launch from the box lands ([`target_for`]) and
//! the PROJECT PICKER behind `^P` ([`ProjectPicker`]). The keys are
//! `event_loop::launcher`'s and the drawing `ui::launcher_view`'s.
