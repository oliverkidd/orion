//! The shape a pull request takes wherever a row names one — the `↗`
//! glyph, the `#42 title` label and a trailing badge — and how a draft, a

/// the preview's `closed` color and dims the rest, so it reads as done-with
/// rather than as a session needing someone — the rail is the surface the
/// STATUS DOT colors own on the rows above.

/// A pull request GitHub says cannot merge — its branch conflicts with the
/// base, or a check is failing (`trouble`) — is red end to end, arrow,
