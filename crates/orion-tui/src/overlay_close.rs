//! The three ways out of an OVERLAY, in one place.
//!
//! Every modal answers to Esc, to a CLICK OUTSIDE and to the HARDWIRED
//! UNLOCK. The Esc arms stay beside the rest of each overlay's keys, because
//! several of them are deliberately two-stage — the first press peels a
//! typed filter or an open submenu and only the second closes. The other two
//! exits live here: both need the same two facts about all sixteen
//! variants, the box the overlay was last drawn in and what has to be put
//! back when it goes, and spelling either of those out per variant is how
//! the list drifts.
