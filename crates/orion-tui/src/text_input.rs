//! Text field with the editing keys a terminal user expects — one line by
//! default, multi-row on request.
//!
//! Every typed field in the TUI — the prompt dialog, the fuzzy filters,
//! the grep query, the ssh destination, the task boxes, a preset's prefix
//! and postfix, an issue's description — is one of these, so the keys are
//! learned once and work everywhere: arrows and Home/End, word motion on
//! ⌥←/⌥→, the readline control chords (Ctrl+A/E/B/F/W/U/K), and word/line
//! deletes.
//!
//! A field holds a SELECTION too, the way a macOS text field does: an
//! anchor where it began and the caret where it ends. Shift on any motion
//! extends it — ⇧←/⇧→ by character, ⌥⇧←/⌥⇧→ by word, ⌘⇧←/⌘⇧→ to the
//! line's ends, ⇧Home/⇧End the same, and in a multi-row field ⇧↑/⇧↓ by
//! row (past the first or last, to the very start or end) and ⌘⇧↑/⌘⇧↓ to
//! the text's ends — and ⌘A takes the whole text. The same motion without
//! Shift lets it go: ←/→ land on its near edge and stop there, every other
//! motion sets out from that edge. Typing, a paste and a line break
//! replace it; ⌫, Delete and the word and line deletes remove just it.
//! Every renderer draws it on the theme's selection background
//! (`ui::field_spans`).
//!
//! A [`TextInput::multiline`] field holds hard line breaks as well, and
//! takes them the way Claude Code's own prompt does: Shift+Enter,
//! Option+Enter — the `ESC` `CR` a terminal without the kitty protocol
//! sends for a mapped Shift+Enter, which is Alt+Enter to us — and Ctrl+J
//! all break the line; ↑/↓ walk the rows as drawn — a long paragraph's
//! wrapped rows too, keeping the column through a short one — and fall
//! through to the caller past the first or last, so a form can step to its
//! next field; ⌥↑/⌥↓ jump by paragraph, Cmd+↑/↓ (Ctrl+Home/End) to either
//! end, PageUp/PageDown a screenful; Home/End and the readline chords work
//! on the line under the caret; a paste keeps its newlines. A one-line
//! field flattens a paste and leaves the break keys to the caller, so
//! Enter — always the caller's — stays the only way out of it.
//!
//! On macOS the option-arrow combos are what actually reaches us as
//! `Alt+b` / `Alt+f`: both Terminal.app (its bundled keyMappings.plist maps
//! `~F702`/`~F703` to `ESC b` / `ESC f`) and iTerm2 send the readline word
//! sequences rather than a modified arrow, so those two chords matter more
//! than `Alt+Left`/`Alt+Right` — we accept both.
//!
//! The field never claims a key an overlay wants for itself: `handle_key`
//! returns [`Edit::Ignored`] for anything it doesn't recognize, and callers
//! run it last, after their own bindings have had first refusal.
