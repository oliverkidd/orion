//! Which row of a list the pointer is on.
//!
//! Every list in the app — the modals' result lists, the pickers, the
//! menus — answers a click with the same arithmetic: the list's box, the
//! index of the first row showing in it, how many rows there are. It was
//! written out in each mouse handler, and a copy that forgot the bounds
//! check or the window offset was a click that landed on the wrong row.
//! This is the one copy.
//!
//! It answers *which row*, and nothing else. What a click on that row
//! *does* is never the mouse handler's to decide: it selects the row and
//! calls the same function the row's key does (`event_loop::activate`, a
//! modal's own `activate_selected`, a `Cmd` executor) — see the note at the
//! top of `event_loop::activate`.
