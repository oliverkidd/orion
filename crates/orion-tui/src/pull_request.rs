//! The pull request on a worktree's branch, discovered with the GitHub CLI
//! (`gh pr view`). What it feeds — the pull request on the worktree's
//! BAND — refreshes on its own, so a PR opened outside orion shows up without
//! anyone typing its URL, and one that has since been merged or closed
//! stays on the row, badged, for as long as the checkout does: the worktree
//! outlives its pull request, and the PR is what you check before archiving
//! or deleting it. Nothing here is the source of truth — GitHub is — but
//! every answer is remembered on disk (`pr_cache`) so the next launch paints
//! the rows from what the last one knew while the lookups catch up. How far
//! the user has read into the conversation is the daemon's (`pr_seen`), so
//! the row can say how many comments landed while they were away.
//!
//! The same `gh` also answers the wider question this module's other half
//! asks — every pull request still open on the *project's* repo, for the
//! PULL REQUESTS MODAL and the header's counts (see [`list`]).
//!
//! `gh` may be missing, unauthenticated, or pointed at a repo with no
//! remote; every one of those is an ordinary "couldn't ask", not an error
//! worth a flash — and, since the last answer is cached, not a reason to
//! blank a row either (see [`Lookup`]). Lookups are async because they hit
//! the network.
