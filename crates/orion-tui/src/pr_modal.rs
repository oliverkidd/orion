//! The PULL REQUESTS MODAL: the selected project's open pull requests,
//! listed down the left in the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP's order — newest
//! first, the drafts sunk below the finished ones — the one under the
//! cursor read on the right, and the ISSUES MODAL's ways to put an agent
//! on it: a QUICK PROMPT (`Enter`), one of the saved AGENT PRESETS
//! (`Shift+Tab`), or a bare harness pick (`Tab`, the group row's NEW
//! AGENT PICKER) — the QUICK PROMPT box's own three keys. Every one of
//! them is a PR SESSION, launched exactly as the group's row launches it
//! (`quick_prompt::pr_launch_for`): the create is a `CreatePrAgent`, the
//! DAEMON runs the session in the project's checkout of the pull
//! request's head branch — reused when one is there, cut otherwise, its
//! stand-in rows up under the pull request from the moment Enter is
//! pressed — and the PR's URL rides the harness's context.
//!
//! The list's filter is live from the moment the modal opens, as the
//! DIFF VIEWER's and the FILE FINDER's are: every letter typed narrows
//! the rows to the fuzzy matches of `#42 title` (`fuzzy::rank`), best
//! first, the cursor on the best, and Esc clears it before a second Esc
//! closes. So the verbs are chords: `Ctrl+c` or `Ctrl+y` leaves a comment (the
//! COMMENT BOX the group row's `y` opens, which comes back to the modal
//! on its row), `Ctrl+g` reads the whole diff, `Ctrl+o` opens the pull
//! request in the browser, `Ctrl+r` asks GitHub again.
//!
//! Nothing is fetched here the panels do not already keep. The rows are
//! the project's open list (`App::open_prs`) — kept warm on the OPEN PRS
//! beat and remembered across launches (`pr_cache`) — so the modal paints
//! at once, and opening it on a list older than [`FRESH`] asks again
//! underneath. The reading side is the PULL REQUEST PAGE the pane shows
//! (`pr_preview`) — its tabs walked with `⇧←`/`⇧→`, a listing's rows with
//! `⇧↑`/`⇧↓`, `^G` opening the diff of the file or commit under the
//! cursor and `^O` the check — fetched on the pane's debounce into the
//! same `App::pr_detail`, so a pull request read in one is read in the
//! other.
