//! The ISSUES MODAL: the selected project's open GitHub issues, listed
//! newest first down the left, the one under the cursor read on the right,
//! and two ways to put an agent on it — a QUICK PROMPT (`Enter`) or one
//! of the saved AGENT PRESETS (`Shift+Tab`), the QUICK PROMPT box's own
//! keys for them. Either launch carries the issue as
//! an [`IssueRef`], and the create that ends it sends the issue URL to the
//! DAEMON (`ClientRequest::CreateAgent::issue_url`), which folds it into the
//! harness's context on every spawn — the system prompt of a harness with
//! a flag for it (Claude, pi, Grok), a cold spawn's first prompt for the
//! rest — so the agent knows which
//! issue the session is for before it reads the first word of the task.
//!
//! `Ctrl+c` (or `Ctrl+y`, the grid's reply key as a chord) leaves a
//! comment on the issue instead: a multi-row box (the task
//! prompts' shape) whose Enter posts the text as you with
//! `gh issue comment`, off the loop, and puts the modal back on its row —
//! the pane says the comment is on its way, and the conversation is read
//! again once it has landed. A post `gh` refused brings the box back with
//! the text, so nothing typed is lost.
//!
//! `Ctrl+e` edits the issue itself, in place: the reading pane becomes a form
//! on its title and description ([`IssueEditor`]), and Enter sends both
//! as one `gh issue edit` off the loop. The form holds until GitHub
//! answers, so a refusal shows `gh`'s reason over text that is still
//! there; a save that took lands on the row at once, and the list is
//! re-asked underneath so the row is GitHub's copy.
//!
//! The list's filter is live from the moment the modal opens, as the
//! DIFF VIEWER's and the FILE FINDER's are: every letter typed narrows
//! the rows to the fuzzy matches of `#15 title` (`fuzzy::rank`), best
//! first, the cursor on the best, and Esc clears it before a second Esc
//! closes. So the verbs are chords — `Ctrl+e`, `Ctrl+c`, `Ctrl+o`,
//! `Ctrl+r` — and the PULL REQUESTS MODAL's filter is this one.
//!
//! Like the pull requests, the issues are the TUI's own business: one
//! `gh issue list` per project — asked in the background once the cursor
//! has rested on the project ([`schedule_prefetch`]), re-asked on a slow
//! beat while it stays selected ([`refresh_selected`]), and again when the
//! modal opens on a list older than [`FRESH`] (or on `r`) — and one
//! `gh issue view` for the comments of the row the cursor rests on, both
//! off the loop with the answer landing on `App::issues_tx`. A `gh` that is
//! missing, unauthenticated, or pointed at a repo with no remote is an
//! ordinary "couldn't ask", said in the pane rather than flashed, and
//! backed off like the open pull requests' list so a machine without `gh`
//! is not asked every beat. Nothing is written to disk: the list is a
//! modal's worth of rows kept in memory, so `i` paints the prefetched rows
//! at once instead of an empty modal while the first answer lands, and a
//! reopen paints the last list while the fresh one lands underneath.
//!
//! The same list is the PROJECT ISSUES GROUP under the Worktrees panel's
//! pull requests (`App::worktree_rows`): one row per open issue, and the
//! pane reads the one the cursor rests on the way it reads a pull request
//! — [`lines`] draws the modal's pane and that one alike — with the
//! comments asked for on the same debounce ([`schedule_detail`]). `p` and
//! `e` on the row are the modal's `Enter` and `Shift+Tab` for it
//! ([`open_prompt_for_row`], [`open_preset_for_row`]).
