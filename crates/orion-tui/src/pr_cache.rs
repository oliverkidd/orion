//! What the pull-request lookups learned, kept on disk between launches.
//!
//! Every answer `gh` gives — each checkout's own pull request (the PR ROW),
//! each project's open list (the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP), the body and
//! conversation the pane read, the diff the modal showed — is remembered
//! here, so the next launch paints all of it at once from what the last
//! one knew, and the lookups that would otherwise leave the panels blank
//! for their first seconds run underneath to bring it up to date. Stale for
//! a moment beats empty for a moment: a row that says `merged` in purple
//! before the sweep has confirmed it is still the right row to be looking
//! at.
//!
//! The cache is never the source of truth. GitHub is, and every hydrated
//! entry is re-asked on the same beats a fresh answer would be — the
//! project's list on arrival, the selected checkout on the next tick, its
//! neighbours one per tick, a cached body the moment the cursor rests on
//! its row. What lands replaces what was hydrated; what fails to land
//! leaves it (see `pull_request::Lookup`).
//!
//! Layout, under the DATA DIR (`ORION_DATA_DIR` isolates it for tests and
//! parallel instances, like everything else there):
//!
//! ```text
//! pr-cache/pull-requests.json   rows, lists and bodies, one document
//! pr-cache/diffs/<url>.diff     one whole `gh pr diff` per pull request
//! ```
//!
//! The document is rewritten whole, atomically, whenever something in it
//! changed — at most once per GIT POLL, and once more on quit. Diffs are
//! big and change on their own schedule, so each lives in its own file,
//! read only when `g` asks for it, and pruned along with the document to
//! the pull requests still on some row.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the disk unless an [`App`] carries a [`PrCache`]:
//! the main loop installs one at startup, the unit tests never do, so no
//! test can read or clobber the real user's cache.
