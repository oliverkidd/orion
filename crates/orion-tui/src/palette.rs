//! The `/` PALETTE: one fuzzy search over every PROJECT, WORKTREE,
//! SESSION and open pull request orion knows about — the "jump to
//! anything" tool. Its rows are built here from
//! the tree; `event_loop.rs` handles the keys and the jump, `ui.rs` draws
//! the rows.
//!
//! The list is FLAT: one row per thing, each drawing the project it lives
//! in dim before its own name — `demo/fix-login` — instead of a header row
//! with its rows indented under it, and instead of a column of full
//! `project/branch/session` paths. Before a query it is the RECENT
//! SESSIONS list: only the sessions, the ones that want you first; typing
//! reaches the projects, worktrees and pull requests too, on lines of
//! their own in that same order.
