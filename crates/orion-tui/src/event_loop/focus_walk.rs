//! The panel walk: focus moving across the old panel columns one at a
//! time, `h`/`l` (←/→) — the path the keys take when the grid does not
//! handle them itself — and the double tap that jumps a walk edge into
//! the pane ([`double_tapped`], which the grid's `k`,`k` and `j`,`j` use
//! too). `event_loop.rs` dispatches the keys; this module decides where
//! focus lands. The state it drives is `App::focus`, `App::edge_tap` and
//! the pane's input lock.
