//! The QUICK PROMPT's last step: the box's `QuickLaunch` plus the typed
//! text, turned into the create the DAEMON sees. A launch into a selected
//! WORKTREE is one `CreateAgent`. A launch into a worktree that does not
//! exist yet (`QuickTarget::NewWorktree` — `p` on the WORKTREES PANEL) is
//! a `CreateWorktree` first, the launch riding its PENDING INTENT, and
//! the same `CreateAgent` once the Ack names the checkout: retargeted at
//! it, the cursor moved onto its row, FOCUS left on the panel `p` was
//! pressed in. With FOLLOW NEW SESSION (`Config::follow_new_session`,
//! on by default) turned off, either launch fired from a session card holds
//! still: the rows go up and the Acks are born left behind, as a
//! BACKGROUND LAUNCH's are, so the cursor and the pane stay on that
//! card. Both rows are on screen from the moment Enter is pressed —
//! stand-ins (`placeholder`) that the Acks turn into the real rows. A
//! launch for a pull request (`QuickLaunch::pr` — `e` on an OPEN PRS
//! row, through the preset picker) is a `CreatePrAgent` instead: the
//! draft carries the PR and `create_agent` addresses it to the PROJECT,
//! whose checkout of the PR's head branch the DAEMON finds or cuts.
