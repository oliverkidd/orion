//! The RELEASE WATCH: one unarchive per press of the key, however long
//! the key is held.
//!
//! A terminal repeats a held key — after its initial delay, then every
//! few dozen milliseconds until the key comes up — and in the legacy key
//! encoding every repeat is another press of the same key, with nothing
//! to tell the two apart. `u` unarchives the card under the cursor and
//! the next card slides under it, so a held `u` walked the ARCHIVED VIEW,
//! a card per repeat — as a held `a` once walked the live grid backwards
//! ("it seemed to have run so fast it archived two"). `a` asks first now,
//! and its repeats land on the confirm, where they are nothing; `u` has
//! no dialog, so the watch is its.
//!
//! The kitty keyboard protocol marks repeats and releases, but only on
//! keys it reports as escape codes — a text key like `u` stays plain text
//! under the flags orion rests on (`host_terminal::KITTY_FLAGS`), and
//! reporting every key as an escape code all the time would cost composed
//! text (a dead key's `é`, a non-Latin layout). So the watch asks for it
//! only while it matters: the press that unarchived flips the host to
//! `host_terminal::HOLD_FLAGS`; the held key's repeats then arrive marked
//! `Repeat` and are swallowed here; its `Release` — or any fresh press —
//! ends the watch and flips the host back. A fresh press of the same key
//! is a new unarchive: the key had to come up first.
//!
//! A host without the protocol (Terminal.app, `orion browser`, tmux)
//! marks nothing, so there a held key's first repeat arrives as a press,
//! ends the watch and unarchives as it always did: the watch is only as
//! good as the host's reports.
