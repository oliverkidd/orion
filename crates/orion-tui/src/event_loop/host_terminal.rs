//! The host terminal — the one orion itself is drawn in — and the modes it
//! is asked for at startup: the alternate screen, mouse reporting, bracketed
//! paste, focus reports and the kitty keyboard flags. `setup_terminal` asks
//! for them and `restore_terminal` hands the terminal back; the rest of this
//! module keeps them true while the loop runs.
//!
//! Two things take them away mid-session. A panic on a worker thread (a
//! `tokio::spawn`ed `gh` lookup, the vim reader thread) unwinds only that
//! thread — the loop survives — so a panic hook that restores the terminal
//! for *every* thread leaves a live UI with no mouse, no raw mode and the
//! primary screen under it. And the host can forget the modes on its own:
//! iTerm2's Session ▸ Reset (⌘R) or a stray RIS clears mouse reporting and
//! the alternate screen without telling the application, after which every
//! click goes to the terminal and the wheel scrolls its scrollback instead
//! of the pane. The hook here restores only for the thread that owns the
//! terminal, and the modes are re-asked on a slow beat and on every resize.
