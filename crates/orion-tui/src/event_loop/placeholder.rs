//! Stand-in rows for a WORKTREE that does not exist yet. The DAEMON's
//! `CreateWorktree` is a fetch plus `git worktree add` plus the WORKTREE
//! HOOK, and the `CreateAgent` after it a CLI spawn — seconds, during
//! which the panels used to show nothing. Now Enter puts the rows up at
//! once, under ids this client made, and the cursors land on them exactly
//! as the real create would leave them: the Ack of each request turns its
//! stand-in into the real row, and an Error takes the stand-ins down and
//! hands the box back.
//!
//! Three boxes create checkouts. The NEW WORKTREE modal (`n` on the
//! WORKTREES PANEL, "New worktree" in a project's menu) puts up the
//! checkout row alone, selected with FOCUS on its empty SESSIONS PANEL —
//! `stage_worktree`. A QUICK PROMPT into a worktree that does not exist
//! yet (`p` on the WORKTREES PANEL) puts up that row and the session row
//! that will follow it — `stage`. A PR SESSION on a pull request whose
//! head branch has no checkout yet (Enter on an OPEN PRS row) puts up the
//! same two rows — `stage` again — behind the one `CreatePrAgent` that
//! fetches the branch, cuts the worktree and spawns in it; there the
//! checkout's upsert adopts its stand-in (`adopt_worktree`), since the
//! Ack names only the session.
//!
//! The rows are ordinary `Worktree` / `Agent` entries in `app.tree` — every
//! list, sort and count treats them as it would the real ones. What marks
//! them is the PENDING INTENT that carries their ids
//! (`App::is_placeholder_worktree` / `is_placeholder_agent`): the intent
//! is removed by the very Ack or Error that resolves them, so nothing has
//! to be kept in sync. Nothing ever reaches the DAEMON under a stand-in
//! id — `send_attach`, `create_agent`, `create_terminal`, the prewarm,
//! the delete and the pane's Input all check first. One launch is held
//! rather than refused: an AGENT PRESET run off the modal's row before
//! the DAEMON has answered waits on the checkout's own Ack
//! (`defer_launch`), and a modal opened on a stand-in — the presets
//! list, its task box — is readdressed to the real row when that Ack
//! lands (`resolve_worktree`).
