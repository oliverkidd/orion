//! What a row does once it is chosen — INPUT IS NOT ACTION.
//!
//! A row can be chosen three ways: Enter with the cursor on it, a click on
//! it, a second click on the row the cursor is already on. The three used
//! to be three implementations, each written where its event is read — the
//! key arm in `handle_overlay_key`, the click arm in `handle_mouse` — and
//! every feature added to one of them was a bug in the others until someone
//! noticed: Enter on a markdown file in the file finder opened the FILE
//! TABS reader while a click on the same row opened the raw editor; Enter
//! in the PR SESSION preset picker launched the PR SESSION while a click
//! launched a plain session into the ROOT WORKTREE.
//!
//! So the handlers only translate. A key arm and a click arm each say
//! *which row* (`list_hit::row_at` for the pointer) and then call the one
//! function here that says *what choosing it does*. Anything that closes a
//! modal, sends a request, spawns a process or moves a cursor as the result
//! of choosing a row belongs in this file (or, for a modal that lives in a
//! module of its own, in that module's single `activate_selected` / `Cmd`
//! executor — `preset_overlays`, `file_tabs`, `issues`, `branch_switch`),
//! never inline in an input handler. `handle_mouse` holding an action of
//! its own is the smell to look for in review.
