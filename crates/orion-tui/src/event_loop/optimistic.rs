//! OPTIMISTIC UPDATES for the verbs that change a row in place — rename,
//! archive, unarchive, delete a session, close a terminal.
//!
//! Each of them used to send its request and wait for the DAEMON to say the
//! row had changed. That answer is quick but not free — the INPUT LATENCY
//! PROBE put a delete's and an archive's at 13 ms, since the DAEMON sweeps
//! the process tree it is about to kill before it answers — and it is only
//! as quick as the DAEMON is idle: behind a `git worktree add`, a prewarm
//! sweep or a busy disk, the row the user just deleted sat there, still
//! selectable, until the answer came.
//!
//! Here the row changes on the keypress. The change is made by handing
//! [`handle_server_event`] the very event the DAEMON is about to broadcast
//! — the same upsert, the same removal — so cursors, the pane, the PALETTE
//! and every count move exactly as they will when the real one lands, which
//! then changes nothing. The request rides a `PendingIntent::Undo` holding
//! the row as it was: an Error puts it back (and flashes why, like every
//! other refusal), an Ack drops it.
