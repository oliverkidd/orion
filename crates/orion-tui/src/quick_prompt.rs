//! The QUICK PROMPT: the hotkey that opens a task box anywhere in the TUI
//! and launches an AGENT on what you type, without walking the NEW AGENT
//! PICKER first. The two are the two ways to start an agent: `p` starts
//! one on a typed task, `n` starts one bare — a harness pick, and the first
//! prompt typed in the CLI — so the picker never ends in this box.
//!
//! What lives here is the launch spec — [`QuickLaunch`]: which AGENT KIND
//! and MODEL / EFFORT the `quick_prompt_kind` SETTING resolves to, which
//! AGENT PRESET (if any) wraps the text, and the [`QuickTarget`] it lands
//! in — the selected WORKTREE, or one that does not exist yet — plus the
//! two pickers that rewrite it for one launch (`Tab`, `⌘U` / `^X`) and
//! the [`QuickReturn`] they — and the box's other pickers, the worktree
//! one whose first row is a fresh worktree among them — carry so the
//! round trip loses neither the spec nor the typed text. The dialog
//! itself is an ordinary multi-line
//! `PromptDialog` (`PromptKind::QuickPrompt`) drawn by `ui::draw_overlay`,
//! and the create it ends in goes through `event_loop::create_agent` like
//! every other session, with the composed text as the STARTING PROMPT
//! (`event_loop::quick_launch` holds that last step). A box opened on a
//! PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP row (`e` there, through the preset picker) is
//! the same box for a PR SESSION: it carries the pull request
//! ([`QuickLaunch::pr`]) and ends in a `CreatePrAgent` instead.
//!
//! A box closed without launching does not take what was typed with it:
//! Esc, a click outside and the HARDWIRED UNLOCK park it as a
//! [`QuickDraft`] (`App::quick_draft`), and the next box opened at the same
//! place — the same worktree, or a fresh one in the same project — takes it
//! back ([`open_box`]). Nor does a window closed with the box up: the text
//! is the SAVED DRAFT on disk as it is typed (`saved_draft`), and a fresh
//! box at that place after a restart opens on it.
