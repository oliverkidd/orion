//! `orion tunnel HOST [PATH] [--port N] [--remote-port N]`: run the remote
//! machine's orion in a browser tab here, with nothing exposed on the
//! remote's network.
//!
//! One `ssh -tt -L local:127.0.0.1:remote HOST` does all of it. The remote
//! command is [`crate::ssh`]'s self-installing prelude with a different tail:
//! `orion browser --no-open --port <remote>`, which stays on the remote's
//! loopback — the ssh channel is the only way in, so there is no port on the
//! box for anyone else to find and no ttyd password to set. `--no-open`
//! because the desktop that should open the tab is this one.
//!
//! If the remote already has a ttyd on that port — a `orion browser` the
//! user left running there, say — the remote command reuses it instead of
//! failing on the port clash: it holds the session open so the forward has
//! something to reach, and starts nothing. See [`REMOTE_SCRIPT`].
//!
//! We spawn ssh rather than exec it (unlike `orion ssh`) because there is
//! work left after the connection: wait for the far end to answer through the
//! forward, then open the local URL. The pty keeps the lifetime honest in
//! both directions — Ctrl+C here reaches the remote orion and ttyd, and
//! losing the connection hangs up the remote side.
