//! The agent status state machine. Pure logic — no I/O, injected clock — so
//! the tricky interleavings (Stop racing SubagentStart, post-turn helpers,
//! idle notifications, foreign sessions) are unit-testable.
//!
//! Semantics ported from mission-control's battle-tested implementation:
//! - `Stop` does NOT mean done while Task-tool subagents are still active;
//!   hold `running` and promote to `finished` only after a drain grace.
//! - A `SubagentStart` shortly *after* a finish heals back to `running`
//!   (the Stop raced the subagent's own hook POST) — but only within a
//!   window, because Claude runs post-turn helpers that fire subagent events
//!   with no following Stop.
//! - Hooks from a different Claude session in the same cwd are foreign and
//!   must not drive status.
//! - An `idle_prompt` notification is Claude reporting it is parked at the
//!   input box; it is what un-sticks a turn that ended without a `Stop`
//!   (rejected prompt, escape mid-turn). But since Claude Code 2.1 the Agent
//!   tool runs subagents in the *background*: the foreground turn ends, the
//!   input box comes back, and `idle_prompt` fires ~60 s later while the
//!   workers are still going. So with subagents tracked it is a hold, not a
//!   finish — the same hold a gated `Stop` gets — and only a quiet set
//!   (no subagent hook traffic for `SUBAGENT_QUIET_GRACE`) is presumed
//!   orphaned and finished anyway.
//! - `Progress` is the same end-of-turn news read straight off the PTY
//!   (OSC 9;4, see `pty::progress`). It is the only signal that survives a
//!   user cancel — no hook fires at all there, and Claude suppresses
//!   `idle_prompt` precisely because the user just touched the keyboard.
//! - Approving a permission prompt fires no hook of its own: the next news
//!   is the gated tool's `PostToolUse` (or the following call's
//!   `PreToolUse`). So a tool event from the same origin as the open
//!   dialog — the foreground turn, or the one subagent whose prompt it was
//!   — is the answer and moves the agent back to `running`. Another
//!   subagent's tool traffic says nothing about a dialog it did not raise.
//! - An `AskUserQuestion` is the exception: Claude runs it alongside the
//!   other calls of the response that asked it, so a read-only `Bash` or
//!   `Read` batched beside the question finishes — and fires its tool
//!   hooks — while the question is still on screen (seen with Claude Code
//!   2.1.272). Only the question's own `PostToolUse` is its answer.
//! - Claude's `permission_prompt` notification is *deferred*: a dialog
//!   sends it once it has sat 6 s with no keystroke, from a timer, with the
//!   hook detached from the turn, and its `AskUserQuestion` dialog sends
//!   the same type (it is a permission dialog in Claude's UI). One can
//!   therefore land just after the answer that closed the dialog, and
//!   would pin a row red for the rest of the turn. Inside
//!   `LATE_PROMPT_NOTIFICATION_GRACE` of leaving `needs_feedback` it is
//!   that echo and is ignored — a genuinely new dialog announces itself
//!   through `PermissionRequest` / `PreToolUse` first, and its own
//!   notification cannot arrive inside the grace.
//! - A `orion worktree` relocation waits on the turn's end, and then the
//!   daemon kills the CLI and resumes it in the target with a prompt that
//!   carries the work straight on (`Daemon::complete_pending_move`). The
//!   end of that turn is not the end of the work: while the daemon says a
//!   relocation is pending (`set_relocating`), a `Stop`, an `idle_prompt`
//!   or a progress-clear holds the row at `running` instead of finishing
//!   it — a death still terminates it — and the respawn starts over as a
//!   launch. Without the hold the card fell to the bottom of the grid for
//!   the seconds between the Stop and the respawned CLI's first hook.
