//! The PR SESSION: an AGENT created from the PULL REQUESTS MODAL. This
//! module owns
//! its launch — the worktree it runs in and the scope rule it carries —
//! and the shape that rule takes for each AGENT KIND's CLI.
//!
//! A PR SESSION never runs in the ROOT WORKTREE. `Daemon::create_pr_agent`
//! finds the PROJECT's worktree checked out on the PR's head branch, or
//! creates one, and every PR SESSION for that PR shares it; the rule names
//! that checkout so the agent works there and nowhere else.
//!
//! The rule is regenerated from the persisted URL and the row's current
//! worktree for every fresh process, so a RESUME cannot silently lose the
//! scope the user chose at creation time. Claude, pi and Grok take it
//! through their system-prompt flag on every spawn. Codex, Cursor, Muse
//! and OpenCode have none, so on their cold spawn it becomes the
//! positional first prompt — their transcripts keep it, so a resume needs
//! nothing added.
//!
//! The ISSUE SESSION — an AGENT launched from the ISSUES MODAL — rides the
//! same plumbing with a different rule ([`issue_rule`]): the GitHub issue
//! the work is for, named so the harness knows what it is fixing, in
//! whichever checkout the launch picked (the selected worktree, or a fresh
//! one cut for the issue). Its URL is persisted beside the PR URL and
//! folded into the same launch prompts on every spawn.
