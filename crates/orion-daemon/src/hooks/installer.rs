//! Managed-hook installation into the agent CLI's config:
//! `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude Code),
//! `~/.codex/hooks.json` (Codex CLI), or `<worktree>/.cursor/hooks.json`
//! (Cursor CLI). Pi and OpenCode have no hook file — their managed
//! TypeScript extension and plugin are `pi_extension.rs` and
//! `opencode_plugin.rs`, which share this module's atomic writer.
//!
//! Claude and Codex share one hooks dialect (PascalCase event names, groups
//! of `{"hooks": [{"type": "command", ...}]}`). Cursor speaks its own
//! (verified against cursor-agent 2026.08 + cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks):
//! camelCase event names (`beforeSubmitPrompt`, `stop`, ...), flat
//! `{"command": ...}` entries, a required top-level `"version": 1`, and each
//! hook must print a JSON response (`{"continue": true}`) to stdout or
//! gating events fall back to fail-open error handling.
//!
//! Rules (learned the hard way in mission-control):
//! - MERGE, never replace: user hooks are preserved untouched.
//! - Our groups carry `_orionManaged: true` and are stripped + rebuilt on
//!   every spawn, so upgrades never accumulate duplicates. A legacy-signature
//!   check (command contains our endpoint + env var) catches untagged strays.
//! - A corrupt file ABORTS the install — never clobber user data.
//! - Commands are env-guarded, so the hooks are inert when the user runs
//!   `claude`/`codex`/`cursor-agent` outside orion (no ORION_* in env →
//!   exit 0).
//!
//! Codex caveat, and the reason its hooks are the one set that does NOT go
//! in the worktree: codex gates every hook behind a startup "Hooks need
//! review" prompt and records the approval in `~/.codex/config.toml
//! [hooks.state]` under the hook FILE'S PATH. Project-local
//! `.codex/hooks.json` therefore re-prompts in every fresh worktree — and
//! an unanswered prompt means no hooks at all, so status stayed grey and no
//! title was ever injected. Installing into `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json`
//! (default `~/.codex`) makes that path stable: the user trusts orion's
//! hooks once and every later worktree is silent. The commands stay
//! env-guarded, so they remain inert in codex sessions outside orion.
