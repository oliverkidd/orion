//! One client's attachment to a session (ATTACH): the replay-then-follow
//! binding behind `ClientRequest::Attach`, and the forward task that keeps
//! that client's pane current from then on — across broadcast lag (a ring
//! resync) and across a respawn of the session's PTY (a fresh binding to
//! the new one).
//!
//! The respawn case is what a restart, a WORKTREE RELOCATION
//! (`orion worktree` → kill + `--resume` at the turn's end) and a cloud
//! re-entry all do: the registry swaps a new `PtySession` in under the same
//! `SessionRef`. A forward task bound to the old PTY would go quiet forever
//! — the client still believes it is attached, so it never asks again — and
//! the pane looks frozen until the user clicks away and back. So the task
//! listens for `Daemon::session_installs` and, when its ref gets a new PTY,
//! rebinds: the client sees a `Scrollback` (its parser resets, an `exited`
//! mark clears) and then the new process's output, on the attachment it
//! already holds.
