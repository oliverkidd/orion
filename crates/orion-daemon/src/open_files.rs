//! instead of pasting it into the reply. Only when asked: the guidance
//! below forbids opening anything unprompted. And text only: the CLI
//! refuses an image or any other binary, since a tab of a PNG's bytes shows
//! nobody anything in a terminal. Like `orion spawn`, nothing here touches

your own initiative — run this shell command, exactly once per set of files:\n\n  orion open \
<file> [<file>…]\n\nwith paths relative to your working directory or absolute. A file you wrote or \
changed, a report, options for the user to pick from: none of these is a reason to open anything \
unasked — name the path in your reply and let the user ask. orion is a terminal app and shows \
text files only; it refuses images, PDFs and other binary files, so name those paths instead of \
opening them. orion shows the files to the user at once, inside this app, as a tabbed modal — one \
tab per file, previewed, editable on Enter — so do not paste the files' contents into your reply \
as well: say in one line what you opened and carry on. If the command fails, report the error and \
name the paths instead.";
