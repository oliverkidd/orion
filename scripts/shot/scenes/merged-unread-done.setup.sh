# The two colors that must not be mistaken for each other, in one frame: the wheel-one-line checkout's
# pull request has merged (fixtures/merged, as in pr-row-merged), and a session under it finished while
# the cursor was elsewhere. So the checkout's row wears the `merged` purple — dot, rail and name, solid: it
# was met already merged, so no ONE-SHOT SWEEP — with the `done` color right beside it in its `1 done` badge
# and on the unread row below. The preset is ORION_SHOT_THEME (`default` when unset):
# `ORION_SHOT_THEME=ocean scripts/shot/shot.sh merged-unread-done`.
