# The frame every THEME shot shares: the PREWARM POOL off, `theme` written before boot (the preset
# named in ORION_SHOT_THEME, `default` here — theme-<name>.setup.sh sets it and sources this file), and a
# stand-in agent that leaves the three scripted launches in three states, so the shot shows every
# status color the preset has to keep apart: launch 1 finishes after the cursor has moved on (unread
# done), launch 2 stays running (the warn sweep), launch 3 stops at a permission prompt (needs feedback).
