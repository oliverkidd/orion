# A stand-in agent that asks for the mouse the way Claude Code's fullscreen renderer does (`?1002h`
# button-motion tracking, `?1006h` SGR coordinates) and prints every report it is handed, so a click
# and a drag typed into the pane show up as the bytes the program received. The PREWARM POOL is off
# so the one launch below is the stand-in.
