# A worktree with more sessions than the SESSIONS PANEL has rows: thirty quick prompts, the newest
# twenty-eight archived, so the ARCHIVED group runs off the bottom of the column — what Ctrl+d /
# Ctrl+u are for there. The PREWARM POOL is off so every launch is one of the scripted rows, and the
# stand-in agent titles its row from the launch counter (`orion rename`, as a real agent does), then
# behaves like /bin/cat.
