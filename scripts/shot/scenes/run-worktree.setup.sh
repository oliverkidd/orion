# A project that says how it is run: a committed .orion.json whose `run` is a stand-in dev server
# (dev-server.sh: a banner, then a request line every two seconds, ending on its own after two
# minutes so a stray run never outlives the harness) and whose `open` names its page. SHELL is
# /bin/sh so the run's pane shows the run rather than this machine's login profile, and the keys wait
# long enough for the run's first lines to land.
