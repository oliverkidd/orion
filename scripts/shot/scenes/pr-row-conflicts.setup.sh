# The stand-in gh answers from fixtures in which GitHub says two of the open pull requests cannot
# merge: #42's branch conflicts with main (`mergeable: CONFLICTING`) and #37 has a failing check in
# its `statusCheckRollup`, while #39 is a plain draft. Both rows of the PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP go
# red, badged `conflicts` and `failing`; `gh pr view` on the wheel-one-line branch finds #37, so the
# checkout's Sessions panel PR ROW is red too, and the PR PREVIEW says `checks failing` beside the
# state. The PREWARM POOL is off so that panel holds nothing but the PR ROW.
