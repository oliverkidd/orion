# LAUNCHER VIEW scenes: the Experimental switch on, the PREWARM POOL off (every launch is one of the
# scripted ones below), two more projects beside the demo for the PROJECT PICKER to type through, and
# a stand-in agent whose three launches tell three stories — one keeps running and opens a pull
# request (it writes the stub gh's `pr view` answer for its own checkout, as a real agent's `gh pr
# create` would make one), one finishes, one stops on a permission question — each painting a short
# transcript so the pane beside the list has something to show.
